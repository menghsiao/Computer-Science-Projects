**This is my second attemp submitting this program.  
The only thing different from the first one is that I output the fail to open file message to std error now instead of to the file.

Describing the structure and function of this program:


This assignment is to write a 'C' program that performs some functions of a file processor.
This is only one .c file.  It has many functions including one main() function to execute the program.

*****	The struct tm *feb4 has been initialized to localtime. <time> will displace the difference in seconds between now and Feb 4th, 2016 5:30 PM.
*****	It will also process <time> as substring inside a string such as hello<time>world<time>!!!!.  and then replace <time> with seconds info.

*****	The #include <filename> will output the file.  And it will do so recursively if the included file also #include <other file>.

*****	Sends to standard error the name of each file and the last modified date/time as specified in the argument


****************************************************************************************************************************************
Basic structure:

Functions to process input to output will do so as following:

keep reading the line of each file until end of file or keep reading the line of standard input until ****  (^c or ^d is pressed)
scan the first word of the first line in the file.
and count how many byte of characters read.
See if the word equals the key phrase "#include".
if 
equals to "#include", move the string pointer forward to how manycharacters read.
read the following word followed by space and exclude <> symbols.
calls the file to stdout function to process the file.

else 
just do the normal read process and search for substring "<time>" inside each word,
if contains substring "<time>", it calls the replaceString() function to replace substring <time> with seconds.
else just output the words and move the pointer forward
*****************************************************************************************************************************************

Main() function:

At the main() function, we are using the getopt facility to support the use of options and with or without values or arguments.
It's like a multiple choice by user to use this program to preprocess text document from the standard input from the console or from the filename(s) specified
in the argument paremeters.  Also user is able to redirect the input from Standard in or from the File(s) to a specific filename followed by the "-f" option.

Standard Input to standard output function():  stdin to stdout;

Standard input to specific filename functon(): by using the freopen to redirect stdout to specific filename;

Input filename output redirect to specific filename function():  
by using the freopen() function: stdout to file; also calls the filename to to starndard output function() and then redirect store in file;


Input filename to standard output function(): takes input from file, send to stdout;


Replace String function(): using pointer and string class function to search substring and use the pointer arithmatic to put a new string together.
